##Abstract

This literature review covers air quality (AQ) monitoring, analysis and mitigation applications along with its variances in regions or individual’s exposure. 
        It covers AQ sensors including outdoor, indoor, wearable and handheld sensors. It evaluates these into low, medium and high cost sensors and identifies the differing factors of these AQ sensors. It determines that low cost sensor in the range £200 - £1000 are often for personal usage often having some sensitivity to anomalies through impacting factors of wind, precision of measurement etc... Whereas medium cost sensor in the range £1000 - £9000 are the lowest cost that are often used for commercial usage. They often are highly calibrated and limited by a few measurement scenarios where accuracy is low such as when air plume are large. High cost sensors in the range £10,000 and above are used for reference sensor by regulatory authorities. There is some potential for price division in the medium cost sensor as the market matures with the most successful sensors priced at the £5000 range. The literature reviews existing networks, their aims and usage. It further covers alternative methods of AQ measurement through satellite means. It further covers both AQ modelling and statistical machine learning for estimating AQ measurements.
          A trend analysis review is conducted of a few use cases were irregular pattern, regular patterns, anomalies, biases and outliers are identified. There are efforts to hypothesis how these are caused by linking to emission sources datasets. The applications and usage of the AQ measurements are reviewed. This includes citizen science initiative, ventilation system optimisation and advocacy. A review of the latest research in all domains benefiting from AQ measurements from emission reduction to health impact of air pollution. A review of the methods of air quality analysis are conducted including geospatial, statistical and machine learning analysis. This results in explaining the ability to automatically identify irregular patterns and predict the next two days AQ measurements. A review of the methods to determine causation of air pollution is conducted with identification of limitations. A review of the mitigation strategies is conducted, existing implementations and potential impacts. A review of the many management strategies of air quality levels and how they differ in regions and scenarios.     
      This literature review provides an expert evaluation of the air quality domain, existing efforts to analyse and positively impact it. It provides basis for initiatives to monitor, analyse and mitigate low air quality levels in many scenarios.
